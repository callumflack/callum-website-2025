I&apos;m Callum Flack—a design engineer and product leader with over 20
years of experience. I design and build beautiful hypertext products that work in the blink of an eye.

My background is design and it informs everything I do. I started my career in branding and graphic design in 1999. I've been designing user interfaces since 2008. Then I started coding in 2011—a natural progression.

## Who I work with

I design and build beautiful hypertext products that work in the blink of an eye.

## Work history

Here's [my CV](/CallumFlackCV2024.pdf). Please [read my case studies](/work). Some highlights:

- I worked at [Vana](/vana), a San Francisco-based start-up from 2022 to 2024 as engineer and designer. Working with a competent, ambitious team on crypto and AI as it was breaking through was a joy.
- I built [Cleared](https://getcleared.com/) from initial commit in 2019 through to its [sale](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/femd-acquires-cleared--a1f894e0) in 2022. I designed and built the UI for the product and marketing websites. I also assembled and lead its engineering team.
- I ran my own freelance agency 2015 to 2020 for Australian and US clients, remote from Cairns. I planned, designed, built and managed projects from initial brief through to launch. I hired teams for some projects.
- In the 00s, I worked as a brand designer at [Saatchi & Saatchi, London](https://saatchi.co.uk/) and George Patterson Bates, Brisbane. You can still find my [turn-of-the-century branding work](breaka) in Australian supermarkets.

## Skill sets and stacks

As a frontend engineer, I'm fluid with React and Typescript. I use tools like TanStack Query or Server Components to bridge the network and database layers. I'm particularly interested in LLMs, design systems and real-time, local-first systems.

As a designer, I use high-res tools such as Figma to derive design systems and assets, or low-res tools such as TLDraw or whiteboards to figure out product flows.

Some people call this mix "design engineering". Either way, I'm competent as a designer or engineer and I love making design real in code.

## Process

> The value of good design is only realised if you have an engineer capable of discerning the details in code (or if you're lucky, they're one and the same).

**Code as design tool.** A decade as graphic designer and a decade as frontend engineer gives me unique agency: I use [code as a design tool](/designers-should-code) to get as close as possible to the nitty gritty of the medium. Being able to design and code simply creates a much faster feedback loop.

**Materialising ideas.** Neither code nor design is the point. Materialising ideas is. As such, I think there is no substitute for the journey of forming [personal taste](/the-matter-of-taste) by [paying attention](/the-instantaneous-language-of-beauty) to the world and making ideas real.

**Tempo.** Knowing the tempo of work is underrated. Are we testing a hypothesis? Running downhill towards a feature release? Nailing a customer experience flow? I keep a tempo in mind at all times.

**Teamwork.** I believe that teamwork [scenius](/creativity-starts-with-love-and-theft) is secret in plain sight. Shared intuitions and mutual at-handedness grease the wheels for [speed](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1380556517208825856) as well as tuning orientations. As such, I work with people first. Good ideas and working systems naturally follow.

## Beyond the screen

I collect music of all kinds and ran multiple [vinyl record labels](https://www.discogs.com/artist/2452856-Callum-Flack) with friends between 2007 and 2013, for which I designed (or rebuilt) all the record covers.

I read books and watch films voraciously; Gerald Murnane's "Border Districts" or Jonathon Glazer's "Under The Skin" are current favourites. My favourite artist is either Agnes Martin or Joseph Cornell.

I've lived in 3 countries and 8 cities. Home is now tropical Cairns, Australia with my wife and children.
