Hi, I'm Callum Flack. I’m a designer, web engineer and product leader.

{/* I design and build beautiful hypertext products that work in the blink of an eye. */}

With 20+ years designing and 12+ coding, I have deep knowhow in each discipline, and more importantly, the ability to think across them. I can take an idea from exploration to working product, collapsing feedback loops and raising the bar.

I've led across contexts: founding a startup engineering team through to its sale, launching a viral AI product before ChatGPT, running an agency, and creating brands at Saatchi & Saatchi. I enjoy the scrap.

{/* I know how to carry ideas from sketch to schema to market. */}

{/* AI commodifies code at the cost of product coherence. Craft is the antidote: building quality with taste. My edge is judgment—knowing what to keep, what to refine, and how to shape the feel of a product in real use, not just in Figma. */}

I can help you:

- **Make better decisions faster.** Design, product, and code expertise in one person.
- **Ship coherent products.** I carry ideas from conversation to prototype to working product, closing gaps and seeing downstream further, faster.
- **Multiply capability.** Lift design, product, and technical thinking across teams.
- **Create customer trust.** Craft is the antidote to AI saturation. Discerning judgment across disciplines enable products that work in the blink of an eye, creating the most valued currency—trust.

Can I help you? Let's talk:

## Work history

Here's [my CV](/CallumFlackCV2024.pdf). Some highlights:

- I worked at [Vana](/vana), a San Francisco-based start-up from 2022 to 2024 as engineer and designer. We built a viral generative AI app before ChatGPT existed.
- I built [Cleared](https://getcleared.com/) from initial commit in 2019 through to its [sale](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/femd-acquires-cleared--a1f894e0) in 2022. I assembled and lead its engineering team, and designed and built the app.
- I ran my own agency 2015 to 2020 for Australian and US clients, remote from Cairns. I planned, designed, built and managed projects from brief to launch.
- In the 00s, I did brand design at [Saatchi & Saatchi, London](https://saatchi.co.uk/) among other places. You can still find my [2000-era brand work](breaka) in Australian supermarkets.

## Skill sets and stacks

As a frontend engineer, I'm fluid with React and Typescript. Not afraid to read/write backend code. I'm particularly interested in the server-client sync, design systems and coding with LLMs.

As a designer, I use high-res tools such as Figma to derive design systems and assets, or low-res tools such as TLDraw or whiteboards to hold conversations about product flows. I love typography, graphic design and UI that elegantly solves hard user problems.

I can work singularly as either designer or programmer. Or both together—what people call "design engineering". You'll get the most value from me by allowing my competencies to "bleed across" domains. I can speak with marketers, designers, founders and engineers, cycling their intents back into the workflow.

## Beyond the screen

I collect music of all kinds and ran multiple [vinyl record labels](https://www.discogs.com/artist/2452856-Callum-Flack) with friends between 2007 and 2013, for which I designed (or rebuilt) all the record covers.

I read books and watch films voraciously; Gerald Murnane's "Border Districts" or Jonathon Glazer's "Under The Skin" are current favourites. My favourite artist is either Agnes Martin or Joseph Cornell.

{/* I ran middle-distance on the track until finishing my degree and played cricket from the age of 7 until my early 30s. Wasn't too bad either (glory days). */}

I've lived in 3 countries and 8 cities. Home is now [tropical Cairns, Australia](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6NQntepU-c) with my wife and children.
