[Replier](https://www.replier.app/) is a web app that lets you quickly respond to questions buried in long messages by choosing what’s important and removing the rest. It helps one to avoid losing important info in the vortex of chat messages and email chains.

I designed and built Replier in collaboration with Jeremy Wortsman at [Jacky Winter](https://www.jackywinter.com/projects) in 2019. It was Jeremy's idea and to this day we still love geeking on tiny utility ideas like this (ideas gestating, watch this space).

It didn't take over the world but it did get some kudos across the [tech](https://x.com/destraynor/status/1262126305241432065) [community](https://x.com/fredericrenken/status/1260638631028420608) on launch. And Superhuman, the email app, [incorporated our idea](https://x.com/Superhuman/status/1291496025547370496) into their product a few months after we launched.

Ps. I still like symbol and typography interrelation in the logotype. The spacing between the keyboard shortcut “r” works both in the logotype and as a logo, large or small.
