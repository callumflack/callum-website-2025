Hi, I'm Callum Flack. I'm a frontend engineer (12 years experience) with a background in branding, graphic and UI design (10+ years).

From vision to details and back again, my job is to build beautiful hypertext interfaces that work in the blink of an eye, creating the most valued currency—trust.

## Work history

Career highlights include:

- I worked as a frontend engineer and designer at [Vana](/vana), a San Francisco-based AI/crypto start-up from 2022 to 2024. We built several products before going viral with Portrait, an AI image generator. Working with a competent, ambitious engineering team was a joy.
- I built [Cleared](https://getcleared.com/) from initial commit in 2019 through to its [sale](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/femd-acquires-cleared--a1f894e0) in 2022. I designed and built the UI for the product and marketing websites. I also assembled and lead its engineering team.
- I ran my own freelance agency 2015 to 2020 for Australian and US clients, remote from Cairns. I planned, designed, built and managed projects from initial brief through to launch. I hired and collaborated with a small team for some projects.
- In the 00s, I worked as a brand designer at [Saatchi & Saatchi, London](https://saatchi.co.uk/) and George Patterson Bates, Brisbane. You can still find my [turn-of-the-century branding work](breaka) in Australian supermarkets.

## Tech stacks and skill sets

As a frontend engineer, I'm fluid with React and Typescript, and I've used Vue and Svelte in the past. My go-to frameworks are Next, Remix and TanStack Start. HTML and CSS are givens. I use tools like TanStack Query and Server Components to bridge the network and database layers. I'm particularly interested in LLMs, design systems and real-time, local-first sync systems.

My background is design and it informs everything I do. I started my career in branding and graphic design in 1999 and have been designing user interfaces (UI) since 2008. When applied to creating for the internet, I consider all these facets crucial to designing the user's experience (UX).

These days I spend most of my time in code but I still love the chance to spend a sprint in design mode. Some people now call this mix of skills a "design engineer" or "user experience engineer". Either way, I'm competent as a designer or engineer and I love making design real in code.

## Process

> The value of good design is only realised if you have an engineer capable of discerning the details in code (or if you're lucky, they're one and the same).

A decade as graphic designer and a decade as frontend engineer gives me unique agency: I use [code as a design tool](/designers-should-code) to get as close as possible to the nitty gritty of the medium. Being able to design and code simply creates a much faster feedback loop.

Neither code nor design is the point. Materialising ideas is. As such, I think there is no substitute for the journey of forming [personal taste](/the-matter-of-taste) by [paying attention](/the-instantaneous-language-of-beauty) to the world and making ideas real.

Knowing the tempo of work is underrated. Are we testing a hypothesis? Running downhill towards a feature release? Nailing a customer experience flow? I keep a tempo in mind at all times.

Lastly, I believe that teamwork [scenius](/creativity-starts-with-love-and-theft) is secret in plain sight. Shared intuitions and mutual at-handedness grease the wheels for [speed](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1380556517208825856) as well as tuning orientations. As such, I work with people first. Good ideas and working systems naturally follow.

## Beyond the screen

I collect music of all kinds and used to run multiple [vinyl record labels](https://www.discogs.com/artist/2452856-Callum-Flack) with friends between 2007 and 2013, for which I designed (or rebuilt) all the record covers.

I read books and watch films voraciously; Gerald Murnane's "Border Districts" or Jonathon Glazer's "Under The Skin" are current favourites. My favourite artist is either Agnes Martin or Joseph Cornell.

I've lived in 3 countries and 8 cities. Home is now tropical Cairns, Australia with my wife and children.
