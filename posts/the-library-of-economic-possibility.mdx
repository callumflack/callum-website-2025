[The Library of Economic Possibility](https://www.economicpossibility.org/) connects economic knowledge across society's concerns. Their mission is to provide the website as a knowledge tool to improve the quality of discourse in order to foster the next economy.

I designed and built the site and developed a graphic brand system in collaboration with founders [Kasey Klimes](https://www.kaseyklimes.com/) and [Oshan Jarrow](https://www.musingmind.org/) over an 18 month period starting 2021.

At the time, I was very interested in ways of enhancing bodies of text with "at hand" pathways to enhance citations, hyperlinks and other appropriate metadata. The marginalia card I designed and built here is a solid example of this.

The knowledge system itself was made up of a five building blocks: reports, insights, sources, authors and tagsâ€”all bi-directionally linked to create pathways between them.

The design system range of typography, colors and iconography all grew from a classic logotype using [Klim](https://klim.co.nz/)'s Heldane serif.
