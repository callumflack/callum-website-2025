Cool description of forward deployed engineers (FDEs) from Nabeel Qureshi's [post](https://nabeelqu.co/reflections-on-palantir) on his time at Palantir:

> Going onsite to your customers—the startup guru Steve Blank calls this “getting out of the building”—means you capture the tacit knowledge of how they work, not just the flattened ‘list of requirements’ model that enterprise software typically relies on.

It goes like this. Get people who can code web apps, send them to the client's workplace to sit in with the client's employees, get them to watch how they work and come up with new ways to build a web app that solves what the engineer deduces the client needs.

This is the Palantir solution to "the system is the problem": parachute engineers into context to create an "end-to-end solution to [their] specific problem, and to hell with generalizability".

The ability to deduce solutions steps from observation (ie. "design") is something every thoughtful and driven person can do—even and especially engineers—and it mostly starts with being immersed in the problem space. From there, with a knowhow of standard software patterns and flows at hand, defining the needs and relations between said needs can start to make up a good solution.

> “Asana, but for building planes”. You took disparate sources of data—work orders, missing parts, quality issues (“non-conformities”)—and put them in a nice interface, with the ability to check off work and see what other teams are doing, where the parts are, what the schedule is, and so on. … These are all sort of basic software things, but you’ve seen how crappy enterprise software can be—just deploying these ‘best practice’ UIs to the real world is insanely powerful.

"Just deploy best practice UIs to the real world" is a great doormat for those "right under my nose" opportunities we've all thought of in the shower.
