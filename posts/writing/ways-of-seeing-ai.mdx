This is a note based on a long-standing unpublished post draft. Since I first wrote that two years ago, everything has changed. So what is there to say?

Krier:

> I think our entire ontology for how we talk about and conceptualise A[G]I is confused. And I wouldn't be surprised if in ten years we will look back at the discourse today and laugh at how primitive some ideas are.

Lapsus said in response:

> The “category error” you describe is, I believe—beyond confusion—symptom. “Alignment” isn’t a solvable problem, it is a script that keeps being rehearsed and restaged without end. Sometimes it stages AI as a sovereign species, sometimes it dissolves into abstraction, but both scripts are recursive loops. The danger is in mistaking these self-reinforcing dramaturgies for reality itself.

This is might short attempt at articulating some recurring ideas I have. I make no attempt to be comprehensive or "right", but rather to record my own thinking.
