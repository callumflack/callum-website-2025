Hi, I'm Callum Flack. I'm a designer and engineer from Australia.

Started designing in 1999 and coding in 2011, with fluency in both. From conversation to prototype to product and distribution, I shorten feedback loops and nail the details that "make it talk".

I've led across contexts: founded a startup engineering team through to its sale, launched a viral AI product before ChatGPT, run a tiny agency, and created brands at Saatchi & Saatchi. I enjoy the scrap.

I believe that discerning judgment across disciplines is the antidote to any mediocre outcome, including AI slop.

Cold emails and new online friendships are welcome.

## Work history

{/* Here's [my CV](/CallumFlackCV2024.pdf). */}

Some highlights:

- Working on personal data sovereignty at [Vana](/vana), a San Francisco-based start-up. This is my second stint (my first was 2022–2024). We built a viral generative AI app before ChatGPT existed. More soon.
- Built [Cleared](https://getcleared.com/) from initial commit in 2019 through to its [sale](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/femd-acquires-cleared--a1f894e0) in 2022. I assembled and lead its engineering team, and designed and built the app.
- Ran my own agency 2015 to 2020 for Australian and US clients, remote from Cairns. I planned, designed, built and managed projects from brief to launch.
- In the 00s, I did brand design at [Saatchi & Saatchi, London](https://saatchi.co.uk/) among other places. You can still find my [2000-era brand work](breaka) in Australian supermarkets.

## Beyond the screen

I collect music of all kinds and ran multiple [vinyl record labels](https://www.discogs.com/artist/2452856-Callum-Flack) with friends between 2007 and 2013, for which I designed (or rebuilt) all the record covers.

I read books and watch films voraciously; Gerald Murnane's "Border Districts" or Jonathon Glazer's "Under The Skin" are current favourites. My favourite artist is either Agnes Martin or Joseph Cornell.

{/* I ran middle-distance on the track until finishing my degree and played cricket from the age of 7 until my early 30s. Wasn't too bad either (glory days). */}

I've lived in 3 countries and 8 cities. Home is now [tropical Cairns, Australia](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6NQntepU-c) with my wife and children.
