I'm Callum Flack—a design engineer and product leader with over 20
years of experience. I design and build beautiful hypertext products that work in the blink of an eye, creating the most valued currency—trust.

My background in design informs everything I do. I started my career in branding and graphic design in 1999. I've been designing user interfaces since 2008. I started coding in 2011—a natural progression.

## Work history

Here's [my CV](/CallumFlackCV2024.pdf). Please read my [case studies](/work). Some highlights:

- I worked at [Vana](/vana), a San Francisco-based start-up from 2022 to 2024 as engineer and designer. We built a viral generative AI app before ChatGPT existed.
- I built [Cleared](https://getcleared.com/) from initial commit in 2019 through to its [sale](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/femd-acquires-cleared--a1f894e0) in 2022. I assembled and lead its engineering team, and designed and built the app.
- I ran my own agency 2015 to 2020 for Australian and US clients, remote from Cairns. I planned, designed, built and managed projects from brief to launch.
- In the 00s, I did brand design at [Saatchi & Saatchi, London](https://saatchi.co.uk/) among other places. You can still find my [2000-era brand work](breaka) in Australian supermarkets.

## Skill sets and stacks

As a frontend engineer, I'm fluid with React and Typescript. I'm particularly interested in LLMs, design systems and real-time, local-first systems.

As a designer, I use high-res tools such as Figma to derive design systems and assets, or low-res tools such as TLDraw or whiteboards to figure out product flows.

I'm competent as a designer or engineer and I love making design real in code. Some people call this mix "design engineering".

## Process

> The value of good design is only realised if you have an engineer capable of discerning the details in code (or if you're lucky, they're one and the same).

**Code as design tool.** A decade as graphic designer and a decade as frontend engineer gives me unique agency: I use [code as a design tool](/designers-should-code) to get as close as possible to the nitty gritty of the medium. It is simply a much faster feedback loop.

**Materialising ideas.** Neither code nor design is the point. Materialising ideas is. I think there is no substitute for the journey of forming [personal taste](/the-matter-of-taste) by [paying attention](/the-instantaneous-language-of-beauty) to the world and learning the trade of making ideas real.

**Tempo.** Knowing the tempo of work is underrated. Are we testing a hypothesis? Drafting it until it's obvious and simple? Running downhill towards a feature release? I keep a tempo in mind at all times.

**Teamwork.** I believe that [scenius](/creativity-starts-with-love-and-theft) is a big secret hidden in plain sight: shared intuitions and mutual at-handedness within a team creates the speed which "prioritises parsimony and substraction in the solution space", as [Collison](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1380556517208825856) says.

## Beyond the screen

I collect music of all kinds and ran multiple [vinyl record labels](https://www.discogs.com/artist/2452856-Callum-Flack) with friends between 2007 and 2013, for which I designed (or rebuilt) all the record covers.

I read books and watch films voraciously; Gerald Murnane's "Border Districts" or Jonathon Glazer's "Under The Skin" are current favourites. My favourite artist is either Agnes Martin or Joseph Cornell.

I've lived in 3 countries and 8 cities. Home is now tropical Cairns, Australia with my wife and children.
