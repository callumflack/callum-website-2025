At 51 stories high, split second decisions count. This is the situation for Bungy guides at the [Auckland Skywalk](https://www.bungy.co.nz/auckland/sky-tower/skywalk/). And at any moment in this situation, there’s a potential once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunity which guides nor customers wouldn’t want to miss. To make it easy for them to not only manage the tour but get that shot, [DWS](https://www.dws.cloud/) hired us to design a custom iOS app that made it quick and easy to do just that.

## The Problem

Guides had to know how to use and navigate around the app at a glance. Not only are guides tasked with photographing the golden moments of each customer, they also have to handle tour logistics. So the app had to allow them to plan around the schedule and update tours on-the-fly, without the guide losing their capacity to act in the moment.

## Solution

### Design from priorities

Given the constrained situation for the guides, the app needed to prioritise for their usability: it had to show guides how to use it without them having to think in the moment.

We spent time researching requirements with the guides and came up with a list. As with any good research, the list was long. And the problem with long lists of requirements is they are never good user experiences: the guide’s capacity to act in the moment is lost if the app's UI allows every possible function.

Like all good design work, many of the workflows required multiple design iterations. The app’s workflows are straightforward and simple now, but the surprising factor in all good design work is that the simple often looked terribly complex to begin with!

### Balancing design decisions

As you can imagine, the worst thing we could do for the guide’s situation is force them through superfluous steps in a given workflow—that could cost them the shot of the day. The key to striking a balance between functional requirements and guide usability was creating a team of three—designer, project manager and guide expert—who were empowered with all design decisions.

Good design is never the result of one person but rather a small group who can—and are empowered to—make the best decision together in the context of the app’s priorities.

### Leverage HIG standards

Unexpected and surprising user interfaces cost users in ways that is hard to measure. A minute lost in a maze of steps means frustration, and with frustration comes loss of task focus, and if it continues any longer, loss of brand trust—if this seemingly simple workflow doesn’t work, what else doesn’t work?

Sticking to [Apple's HIG standards](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines) to implement workflows within the bounds of common user interface paradigms means users will already be familiar with how things are supposed to work.

The design’s job was to put that common knowledge to best use, and—wherever possible given the app’s custom requirements—give guides the interface they expected. No surprises, no frustration and no loss of focus.

## Outcomes

After a rigorous testing period, the app is now in use. With the coinciding release of the Epic Platform, the app has garenered generouse reviews from New Zealand tech and adverture media alike.
