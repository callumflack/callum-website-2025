## Derived Props

Let's continue with the dialog example. What if you wanted the `Dialog` to not be closable?

I have seen this several times in various codebases. Most people just add an `isClosable` boolean prop to the component:

```tsx
<Dialog
  isOpen={isDialogOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsDialogOpen(false)}
  isClosable={false}
/>
```

The problem here is that such an impromptu approach to adding single use case props to components usually ends up with having components with 20 props and having to do a lot of mental gymnastics to figure out how all the boolean combinations work together.

Instead, for such behavior we can reuse the existing `onClose` prop. If it is passed, we should consider the dialog closable, and if not, then it is not closable!

```tsx
// Closable (onClose is provided)
<Dialog
  isOpen={isDialogOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsDialogOpen(false)}
/>

// Not closable (onClose is omitted)
<Dialog isOpen={isDialogOpen} />
```

This is just one example, but a good rule of thumb is that **if you're adding a boolean prop to a component, you should consider if it can be derived from any existing props**.

## Enum Props

Boolean props are fine, don't get me wrong. But consider this flawed example—what should the Button look like?

```tsx
<Button isPrimary isSecondary />
```

It is an impossible state, you can't reasonably expect a button to be of both primary and secondary state. Enum props make impossible states impossible:

```tsx
<Button variant="primary" />
<Button variant="secondary" />
```

Further, you get better autocomplete support for enum props as you type out the prop, and get to pass the variant prop into a data attribute for styling:

```tsx
function Button({ children, variant }) {
  return (
    <button className="button" data-variant={variant}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Isn't this more pleasing to work with over conditionally setting classes?

```tsx
function Button({ children, isPrimary, isSecondary }) {
  return (
    <button className={isPrimary ? "primary" : isSecondary ? "secondary" : ""}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Preserving Autocomplete with String Union Types

Alright, so what if I have an enum prop but I want it to also accept any arbitrary value?

Consider this button that has a preset of design system colors but you want it to also accept a random color, like a HEX code:

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  color: "accent" | "warning" | string;
}
```

It makes sense to type it with `string`, right? Well, kind of... but you lose the autocomplete functionality in code editors. To retain autocomplete for your design system values, you can type the string like so:

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  // Loses autocomplete
  color: "accent" | "warning" | string;

  // Retains autocomplete ✓
  color: "accent" | "warning" | (string & {});
}
```

Why does this make sense? I have no idea, but I found it on the internet and it works.

## Composability

You've likely seen some components from Radix UI or Base UI that have multiple components that are used together. This is called a **compound component**.

```tsx
<DropdownMenu.Root>
  <DropdownMenu.Trigger />
  <DropdownMenu.Portal>
    <DropdownMenu.Content>
      <DropdownMenu.Label />
      <DropdownMenu.Item />
      <DropdownMenu.Separator />
      <DropdownMenu.Arrow />
    </DropdownMenu.Content>
  </DropdownMenu.Portal>
</DropdownMenu.Root>
```

But you might be wondering, isn't this a lot of boilerplate? Yes and no. These libraries are intentionally low-level, meaning they expose internal parts for you to hook into, avoiding prop bloat that component libraries usually suffer from due to all kinds of use case requests.

### Why Compound Components?

You now have control over every element rendered as part of the dropdown:

- Want to add a class name to the separator? Just add it to the component, no passing in nasty `separatorClassName` props down from the parent.
- Don't want an arrow for the menu? Just don't render it, no need for a `hasArrow` boolean prop.

Generally, you would wrap a low-level collection of components into a high-level component that uses parts of it to make a dropdown menu for your design system.

### Composition vs Data Props

Now, the name of the game here is composability. Consider this example of the `Slides` component:

```tsx
<Slides>
  <Slide title="Prop naming">
    <p>...</p>
  </Slide>
  <Slide title="Composability">
    <p>...</p>
  </Slide>
</Slides>
```

It's not just beautiful to look at but easier to navigate through visually. Compare this to an inferior component that just takes in a data prop:

```tsx
<Slides
  data={[
    {
      title: "Prop naming",
      children: <p>...</p>,
    },
    {
      title: "Composability",
      children: <p>...</p>,
    },
  ]}
/>
```

Yikes. Not only have we lost JSX, but if you wanted to pass in any additional attributes to each item, you would have to make sure the data prop supports them.

### The Trade-off

This data-prop approach is often attractive because you have access to the entire collection of items from `Slides`. You can easily determine which item is active or selected.

With composition, you need each descendant to register itself in a collection with a reference to the HTML element, and pass it the active state:

```tsx
function Slides({ children }) {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
  const slides = useRef<HTMLDivElement[]>([]);

  return (
    <div>
      {React.Children.map(children, (child, index) => {
        return React.cloneElement(child, {
          ref: (node) => {
            slides.current[index] = node;
          },
          active: activeIndex === index,
        });
      })}
    </div>
  );
}

function Slide({ children, title, active }) {
  // ...
}
```

Now, this approach generally works fine but has its limitations. There would be bugs here if the children were to change because it doesn't handle removing elements from the list when a component unmounts. This is a really hard problem exclusive to React. If you're curious, I recommend looking at how Radix builds their components with the [collection utility](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/tree/main/packages/react/collection).

### Creating Compound Components

Finally, to create compound components, I've found this approach to work well:

```tsx
function Root() {}
function Slide() {}

export const Slides = Object.assign(Root, { Slide });

// Usage:
<Slides>
  <Slides.Slide />
</Slides>;
```

## Direct Manipulation

Often times animation or interaction libraries manipulate the DOM directly, instead of relying on React to reconcile diffs between the virtual and actual DOM.

### The Problem with High-Frequency React Updates

Try moving your mouse around to observe how slow high-frequency React updates from interactions can be with a complex document.

```tsx
// Using React state (slow - causes re-renders)
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

function onMouseMove(e) {
  setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
}

// Render count: many (60 FPS causes 60 re-renders per second)
```

### The Solution: Direct DOM Updates

Instead, if you know what you're doing and other parts of your interface don't rely on this state, it is much more performant to update the element directly from the callback because it doesn't trigger a re-render:

```tsx
const ref = useRef(null);

function onMouseMove(e) {
  ref.current.style.translate = `${e.clientX}px ${e.clientY}px`;
}

<div onMouseMove={onMouseMove}>
  <div ref={ref} />
</div>;

// Render count: 1 (initial render only)
```

This bypasses React's reconciliation entirely, giving you smooth 60 FPS animations without the overhead of virtual DOM diffing.
